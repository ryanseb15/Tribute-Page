# Tribute-Page
This page was made as a tribute for Pel√©, former soccer player and Brazil's Minister of Sports.
This page contain his path in some of his achievements as a active player.
This project was made using HTML and some new skills in CSS that I learned in the Responsive Web Design course on freeCodeCamp.
